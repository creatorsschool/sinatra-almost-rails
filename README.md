# Creators School Sinatra skeleton

This is a very basic example of a Sinatra app with CRUD routes as similar as possible to Rails' `resources`

## Getting Started

To get started run the following commands:

```
bundle install
bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

## Running the app

To run the app we are using [shotgun](https://github.com/rtomayko/shotgun),
which means you can run just by typing `shotgun`.
